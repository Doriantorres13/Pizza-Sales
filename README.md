# Pizza Sales Analysis and Dashboard

This project involves the analysis of pizza sales data using SQL and visualizing the results with a Tableau dashboard. The goal is to gain insights into sales performance, customer preferences, and trends, which can inform business decisions related to menu optimization and marketing strategies.

Project Components

1. Database Setup
A database named Pizza_DB was created to store and manage pizza sales data.
The primary table used for analysis is pizza_sales, containing detailed information on each order, including order date, time, total price, quantity, pizza name, category, and size.

2. SQL Analysis
SQL queries were used to extract key insights from the pizza_sales table. The main areas of focus included:
- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
    - Total Revenue: Calculated the overall revenue from pizza sales.
    - Average Order Value: Measured the average spending per order.
    - Total Pizzas Sold: Provided the total number of pizzas sold.
    - Total Orders: Counted the number of unique orders placed.
    - Average Pizzas Per Order: Determined the average number of pizzas per order.
- Trend Analysis:
    - Hourly Trend for Total Pizzas Sold: Analyzed pizza sales by the hour to identify peak sales periods.
    - Weekly Trend for Orders: Tracked the number of orders placed weekly to understand demand over time.
-Sales Breakdown:
    - Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category: Assessed the contribution of different pizza categories to total revenue for a           specific month.
    - Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size: Examined the revenue generated by different pizza sizes in a given quarter.
- Top and Bottom Performers:
    - Top 5 Pizzas by Revenue: Identified the pizzas that brought in the most revenue.
    - Bottom 5 Pizzas by Revenue: Highlighted the pizzas with the lowest revenue.
    - Top 5 Pizzas by Quantity Sold: Listed the pizzas sold in the highest quantities.
    - Bottom 5 Pizzas by Quantity Sold: Showed the pizzas with the lowest quantities sold.
    - Top 5 Pizzas by Total Orders: Ranked the pizzas ordered most frequently.
    - Bottom 5 Pizzas by Total Orders: Revealed the pizzas with the fewest orders.
 
3. Tableau Dashboard
A Tableau dashboard was created to visualize the results of the SQL analysis. The dashboard includes two different screens with various graphs and charts, offering an intuitive overview of the key metrics and trends.

4. Key Insights
- Peak sales hours, popular pizza categories, and sizes were identified, helping to optimize inventory and marketing strategies.
- The analysis of top and bottom-performing pizzas provided insights into customer preferences, allowing for better menu          planning.
- Understanding average order values and pizzas per order can aid in pricing strategies and promotional offers.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how SQL and Tableau can be effectively used together to analyze sales data and derive actionable insights. The visualization of data through a dashboard not only enhances understanding but also aids in decision-making processes for business growth and customer satisfaction.
